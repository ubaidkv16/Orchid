        <h4 class="display-4">Cosmos bipinnatus</h4>
        <br>
        <p>
            Cosmos bipinnatus is considered a half-hardy annual, although plants may reappear via self-sowing for
            several years. The plant height varies from 2–6 ft (0.61–1.83 m), and rarely to 9 ft (2.7 m). The cultivated
            varieties appear in shades of pink and purple as well as white. The branched stem is usually densely to
            occasionally occupied by fine, split up, rough trichomes, some specimens are completely hairless. The
            petiole itself is inconspicuous, winged, 10 (rarely to 15) mm long, sometimes the leaves are almost sessile.
        </p>
        <p>
            The partial leaves are linear-filiform to narrow linear with a width of 0.5 to 1 (rarely to 1.7) mm; the
            tips are pointed, hardened, but not particularly sharp. Its foliage is finely cut into threadlike segments.
            When flowering, the plant can become top heavy. This problem is alleviated when grown in groups, as the
            bipinnate leaves interlock, and the colony supports itself.[7]
        </p>
        <p>
            The achenes become blackish, are smooth or short-bristly. Their shape is spindle-like. They are rounded off
            into a short, 0.5 to 1.7 mm long, but distinctly pronounced rostrum. The inner achenes are up to 18 mm long,
            their yellowish beaks are 4 to 5 (rarely to 10) mm long. A pappus is missing or it consists only of two to
            three awn-like, 1 to 3 mm large bristles.[8]
        </p>
        <h4>Flowers</h4>
        <p>
            Cosmos bipinnatus flowers in Sivas, Turkey
            The very conspicuous cup-shaped inflorescences have a diameter of usually 5 to 7 (rarely 8) cm and contain
            tongue and tubular flowers, which are surrounded by bracts. The outer bracts are usually eight and are ovate
            to lanceolate-tail-shaped, 7 to 15 mm long, 3 to 5 (rarely 6) mm wide. The inner bracts are ovate-lanceolate
            and 8 to 12 mm long. They are translucent with many black stripes and a clear edge up to 1 mm wide,
            sometimes with yellowish or pink pigments, the tip is ciliate. The sprout leaveshave gold-yellow,
            thread-like tips and protrude between the tubular flowers. The broadened base of these spreader leaves is
            translucent, provided with a yellow line. During flowering, the plant can sag under its weight. This problem
            can be solved by grouping the feet together so that the leaves hang together.
        </p>
        <p>
            The mostly eight ray florets are pink to violet or white colored, at the base may show noticeable stains
            caused by anthocyanin. The tongues are reversely ovate shaped, have a length of usually 20 to 35 (16 to 40)
            mm and a width of usually 12 to 20 (8 to 25) mm. The tips are almost dull and have three broad, wavy teeth.
            Below that, they are greatly rejuvenated. In the center of the flower baskets is a large number of tubular
            flowers (also called disc florets), whose overgrown petals are yellow, turn white in the lower part and
            reach a length of 5 to 6 mm. The anthers are brownish-black and about 3 mm long, at the tips are
            short-triangular, translucent attachments with a length of 0.5 to 0.8 mm. The branches of the stylus are
            short and rather dull, with a length of 0.5 mm.[9]</p><br>
